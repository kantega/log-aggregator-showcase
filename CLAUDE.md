# Log Aggregator Showcase

This is a **presentation demo project** for "Claude and the Mystery of Integrations." It showcases how to test third-party integrations using mock servers, failure scenario testing, and exponential backoff — all built with Claude Code assistance.

## What this project is

A microservice-based log management system that archives data to external NOARK-compliant archiving systems through an adapter pattern. The key point: the external systems (Noark A, Noark B) are on the customer side and we can't control them. We mock them for testing.

## Architecture

## Data flow

1. User creates a log group, adds string entries, closes the group (via Angular UI → Log Manager API)
2. Every mutation (create, add entry, close) publishes an event to RabbitMQ (exchange: `log-manager-exchange`, routing key: `log.event`)
3. Edge consumes events, tracks archive state in MongoDB, and pushes data to both Adapter A and Adapter B
4. Adapter A transforms data to JSON and POSTs to Noark A; Adapter B creates a ZIP and POSTs to Noark B
5. In dev/test, adapters point to `external-apis-mock` instead of real Noark systems

## Services

| Service | Port | Tech | What it does |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| `frontend/` | 4200 | Angular + Tailwind | UI: log management (left), system overview panels (right) |
| `log-manager/` | 8080 | Spring Boot + MySQL | REST API for groups/entries, publishes to RabbitMQ |
| `edge/` | 8081 | Spring Boot + MongoDB | Consumes RabbitMQ, tracks archive state, routes to adapters, retries failures |
| `adapter-noark-a/` | 8082 | Spring Boot | Transforms to JSON, POSTs to Noark A |
| `adapter-noark-b/` | 8083 | Spring Boot | Transforms to ZIP, POSTs to Noark B |
| `external-apis-mock/` | 8084 | Spring Boot | Controllable mock of Noark A & B with `/api/test/setup`, `/api/test/reset`, `/api/test/history` |
| `integration-tests/` | — | Playwright (Node.js) | E2E tests with browser automation |

## API Documentation

All services expose auto-generated API docs via SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI). When running, access them at:
- Each service: `http://localhost:<port>/swagger-ui.html`
- Frontend: click "Docs" button or navigate to `http://localhost:4200/docs`

## Running the project

```bash
./start-all.sh          # starts Docker infra + all services + frontend
# type 'stop' to shut down
```

Or start infrastructure only: `docker compose up -d`

## Testing and debugging

**This project maintains two test suites that must stay in sync.** When adding new functionality that changes pipeline behavior, you MUST add coverage in both:

1. **Java `FullPipelineIT`** (`edge/src/test/java/no/kantega/edge/FullPipelineIT.java`) — API-driven integration test with TestContainers
2. **Playwright E2E** (`integration-tests/tests/`) — browser-based tests against the live stack

Run `/testing-guide` for the full guide on how to add tests at all three levels, including helpers, API references, and the key differences to account for (retry scheduler, assertion style, etc.).

```bash
# Java integration test
cd edge && mvn test -Dtest=FullPipelineIT

# Playwright E2E tests
cd integration-tests && npx playwright test --trace on
cd integration-tests && npx playwright test tests/specific.spec.ts # run one test
```

The `integration-tests/` folder also has Playwright agents for test planning, generation, and healing, plus its own CLAUDE.md with details on running tests.

## Working with sub-projects

Two sub-projects have their own `.claude/` configuration with specialized tools:

- **`integration-tests/`** — has its own CLAUDE.md, 3 Playwright agents (planner, generator, healer), a playwright-cli skill, and a playwright-test MCP server for browser automation
- **`frontend/`** — has its own CLAUDE.md with Angular/TypeScript coding standards, and an angular-cli MCP server

**Important for agents started from root:** The playwright skill, MCP servers, and agents in sub-folders are NOT available when running from the repo root. If your task involves:

- **Writing or running Playwright tests** → Write the test files from root, but run them with `cd integration-tests && npx playwright test`
- **Debugging UI in a browser** → You need to be started from `integration-tests/` to access the playwright-test MCP and browser automation agents
- **Angular-specific work** → Read `frontend/.claude/CLAUDE.md` before modifying Angular code (signals, OnPush, standalone components, etc.)

## Presentation demo flow

This project exists for a live demo with three acts:
1. **Happy path** — run the e2e test showing the full create → archive flow working
2. **Error handling** — configure the mock to return 500s, show Edge captures failures in MongoDB
3. **Live coding** — implement exponential backoff with Claude Code, run the backoff test to prove it works

## Important context for Claude Code agents

- All Spring Boot services use Java 17, Spring Boot 3.5.x, Lombok
- RabbitMQ credentials: user `myuser`, pass `secret`
- RabbitMQ Management UI: http://localhost:15672
- MySQL credentials: user `myuser`, pass `secret`, root pass `verysecret`
- MongoDB credentials: user `root`, pass `secret`
- The frontend uses `data-testid` attributes throughout — use these for Playwright selectors
- Check `PLAN.md` for current implementation status and what's left to do
- Check `PRD.md` for full product requirements
